Capstone Project for Ada Developers Academy C8

### Dependencies Used:
- Nodemon: watches our server.js file for changes, then restarts it.
- Mongoose: abstracts away the MongoDB boilerplate for a simple Schema solution.
- Express: provide a framework to set up our Node.js server.

##### Dependencies I may use: 
- Axios: let us use HTTP methods to communicate with our database.
- Body Parser: parse the incoming requests bodies for the info we are sending (gives us access to `req.body` which we will be using soon).
- Foreman: allows us to boot up our API and webpack-dev-server simultaneously.
